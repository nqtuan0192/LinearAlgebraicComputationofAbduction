GENERAL 

This software executes the benchmark evaluation described in the paper and 
returns csv files with the evaluation results.
Please refer to the paper for all used tools and reimplemented algorithms.

This research prototype has been developed on macOS Sierra (Version 10.12.5)
and tested on (OS X Yosemite 10.10.5). 


RUNNING THE SOFTWARE

Call the software with "<folder> [timeout in ms]", where <folder> is the 
directory containing the diagnosis examples and [timeout in ms] is an optional 
argument where you can specify the timeout (the default value is 20 min as used
in the evaluation.). 

We provide an executable for clingo (www.potassco.org/clingo/), however, this 
may not be suitable for other operating systems than macOS. In case it does not
work, try to download clingo yourself and add the executable to the lib folder 
of the software.

Make sure to insert clingo into the folder "lib/clingo/" and do not remove the
file "abduction.dl". For SOLAR it is necessary that the jar is in the correct
folder "lib/SOLAR/" and named "solar2-build315.jar".
